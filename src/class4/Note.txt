Operators:
are different symbols that we can use to perform day to day operations like addition.
we can compare things if two entities are same or not if not a number is greater than the other number or not.
There are three main types of operators. 3)Logical
1) Arithmetic: we use these operators to perform simple math operations. like +,_...etc
 + ==> Addition
 - ==> Subtraction
 / ==> Division
 * ==> Multiplication
 % ==> Modulus, Reminder

2) Relational: There used to compare two quantities or entities. like if something is bigger
than other thing of if two number are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
== ==> equal, used to check if two variables contain the same value or not, so computer will write us true otherwise false
!= ==> not equal, used to check if two variables not equal or not contain the same value. we will get true if they are not the same.
> ==>  greater, used to check if one value is greater than other value or not, if greater we will get true
< ==>  lessen, opposite of > used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get true if yes.
>= ==> greater and equal, if the values on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same we will get a true.
<= ==> lessen and equal to, opposite of >= and used to check if a value is less than or equal to other value.

Conditional Constructs: used to write conditional codes, a piece of code that execute based on a condition.
if the condition is true java will print the code otherwise it skips that code.
How to write IfElse conditions:IfElse conditions. works based on regional operators.
if(condition){ any line of codes you want java to print}

if(condition){ we can put one if condition inside another if condition.
sout(any line of codes you want java to print)}
if(condition){sout (any line of codes you want java to print)}

If else conditions
when we I have to test the same variable for multipal conditions I should use if else If
when we I have multipal conditions and these conditions are depend on each other Nested if condition

Important Notes:
1) for string we use equals method instead of == sign because it is a non-primitive data type
2) we can ctrl+alt+l for windows to format our codes for mac cmd+opt+l
3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part

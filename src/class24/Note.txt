Abstraction:
     Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the user.
     In java, we can achieve this in two ways 1) Abstract classes 2) interface.
Interface:
     It is very similar to a abstract class. We can have private methods static methods default methods abstract method we can
     be static in an interface. we can't have instance fields in an interface and because we don't have instance fields we also
     can't have a constructor in an interface.

     A way to achieve abstraction for unrelated classes through implementation

When we should use interface:
    when objects are closely related to each other and there is  "Is a " relationship between classes then
     we should go with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction. if Objects are not related to each other then we should
     implement abstraction with the help of interfaces.



in an abstract class we can have constructor only because it might be needed for child class but in interface
we are not allowed to create constructor

same logical domain Animal--> cat dog horse cause there is a relationship
Laptop under animal no logical domain because we can not find similar features or behaviours.

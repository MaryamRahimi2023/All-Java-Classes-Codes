Iterator:
 is an interface if you want to remove add something or planing to do an operation which can change the size of a list at run time
 than we should use iterator.

 In Java, an Iterator is an interface that is used to traverse (iterate over) a collection of objects, such as ArrayList, HashSet, or LinkedList.
 An Iterator allows you to loop over the elements in a collection and perform operations on them, such as removing or adding elements.
 The Iterator interface provides methods for checking if there are more elements in the collection (hasNext()), retrieving the next element in the
 collection (next()), and removing the current element from the collection (remove()).

Sets like HashSet,LinkedHashSet and TreeSet don't allow duplicate values. There are three main types of Sets
HashSet:
    Upside:Fast
    Downside: Does not retain the insertion order
LinkedHashset:
    Upside: Retains the insertion order.
    Downside: it's slower than HashSet.
TreeSet:
    Upside:it keeps the data sorted
    Downside: it's the slowest.

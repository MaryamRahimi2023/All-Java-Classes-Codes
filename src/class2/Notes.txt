Java follows some rules for naming things like classes and boxes (Variables)
1) While naming a class first letter of all the words should uppercase for example DecimalNumbers.
2) While giving name to variables or boxes first letter of all the word should be uppercase except the first word ex: myBox
3) While creating a project the first letter of all words will be uppercase without space.

Perimitive data types:

numaric= byte, short, int, long, float, double,
non numaric= char, boolean

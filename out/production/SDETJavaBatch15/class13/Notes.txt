When we should use String class:
   when we want to save as much memory as possible, and we are okay if the programs get a little slow.like mart watches less memory so slow
When should we use String Builder class:
   when we want maximum speed, and we don't care how much memory our programs going to occupy.
What does it mean by String is immutable:
    it means Strings are not changeable once created in the memory of the computer,
    and the reason they are immutable is that same memory cell can be shared across many variable and if we allow any of the variable
    to change the value it can break the complete system.

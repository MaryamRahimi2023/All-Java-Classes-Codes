Java is 99.9%  Object oriented programing language because of the (like Strings which we can call reference data types)
and only not 0.01% because of the premative datatype that are not object and drived from class
which are int, char, float, boolean, {Integer, Byte ... etc (wrapper classes)}

collection framework: group of class and interfaces with undefined methods which we can implement
 which  help  in  storing  and processing the data efficiently.
list provide grow in collections during the run time. List is an interface and have implementation class which are ArrayList,Linklist,vector,stack
ArrayList is a part collection framework and wrapper classes as well

class wrapper: we use this with ArrayList coz can not store primitive type there
Overall, while it's not possible to directly use primitives as reference types, you can use wrapper classes
to convert them to objects and access methods and properties that are only available for objects.

Autoboxing converting primitive in to object : Integer num1=10; also called Boxing
outboxing getting the primitive value from object: int num2=num1;num2.intValue();

wrapper classes are the way to use primitives as a reference type
to use function that is available
To convert primitive data to the object
converts primitives to reference values to get methods accessible,
